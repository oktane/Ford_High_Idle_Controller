Automatic High Idle Resume
code and design by oktane - 2012

On the latest 2011 ford truck models with the 6.7l engine, the PTO will not auto re-engage as it used to. So if anything causes it to disable, such as accidentally hitting the service brake, it will be locked out. This requires you to turn off your PTO/High Idle dash switch and turn it back on, or the system will be locked out and not function.
This circuit solves this annoying problem. Now when there is a call for high idle, if interrupted (parking brake, brake, gas pedal, etc), the system will auto resume in 5 seconds. This is important in an emergency vehicle where the high idle is controlled by a load manager. Previously it would be unreliable, as the load manager does not sense if the high idle is working or not, it expects the high idle to work when its told to.

Construction details:
A .100 header was used on a Radio Shack perf board to interface to the Arduino. I used a 5v relay with an NPN transistor to drive it from the Arduino. A 7805 is used to provide the arduino regulated power. LED's are added to show what is going on, and console output is provided if the unit is plugged in via USB to a laptop. The circuit is designed in such a way that if the microcontroller fails or gets disconnected, the external high idle switch signal should pass through. Therefore the operator can still control it from the dash in a fault.

After the unit was tested, it was coated in many layers of epoxy for durability in a harsh enviroment. It was installed under the dash, zip tied to the main harness, for a clean install. Note that in the pictures under the dash, the bosch auto relay to the right of the unit is not related to this circuit. (Tis the jackass radio installers relay, they did a horrible job)

This project was done for an emergency fire department vehicle, where high idle is important for electrical loads. Ford was contacted for solutions and they were not interested, in fact they seemed offended I suggested the behavior was not well designed. The behavior this circuit forces is exactly what the trucks used to do before they changed the ECU firmware. Anyways, faster to roll your own solutions when facing immovable and arrogant corporate beauracracy. Millions of peices of emergency equipment will require similar systems in the years to come, if based on Ford chassis, they will have this issue until Ford can figure it out.
